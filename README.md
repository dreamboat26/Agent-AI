# Agent-AI
Welcome to the AI Toolbox Agent repository! This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence agent capable of utilizing a wide range of tools provided to it, enabling versatility and adaptability across various tasks and domains. This work has been inspired from the AI Agent video by Tech with Tim.

## Overview

The AI Toolbox Agent leverages a modular architecture designed to integrate diverse tools and techniques, empowering it to handle an array of tasks efficiently. By combining cutting-edge AI algorithms with traditional software tools, the agent can adapt its approach based on the specific requirements of each task.

## Features
- Modular Design: The agent is built with a modular architecture, allowing seamless integration of new tools and algorithms as needed.
- Tool Selection: It intelligently selects and utilizes the most appropriate tools from its arsenal based on the task at hand.
- Adaptability: With machine learning capabilities, the agent can learn and improve its tool selection process over time, optimizing performance.
- Task Variety: From data analysis to natural language processing, the agent is equipped to handle a wide range of tasks efficiently.
- Scalability: As new tools and technologies emerge, the agent can easily scale and incorporate them into its repertoire.

## Included Data and Files
- India.pdf: A document containing data and information about India.
- population.csv: A CSV file containing population data. <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/world-population-by-country-2023>
- notes.txt: A text file where the generated sentences by the model are saved based on the prompt.

Usage
- Install Dependencies: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed to run the AI Toolbox Agent.
- Configure Settings: Customize the agent's settings and preferences according to your requirements.
- Input Task: Provide the agent with the task you want it to perform.
- Execute: Let the agent autonomously select and utilize the most suitable tools to accomplish the task.
- Review Results: Evaluate the agent's performance and provide feedback for improvement if necessary.
